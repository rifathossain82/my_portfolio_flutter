String blog2_detailsTitle2='Quick compilation: maximum productivity';
String blog2_detailsdes2='Thanks to Flutter, you can change your code and see the results in real-time. It’s called Hot-Reload. It only takes a short amount of time after you save to update the application itself.\n\nSignificant modifications force you to reload the app. But if you do work like design, for example, and change the size of an element, it’s in real-time!';

//blog5 details
String blog5_detailsTitle1='Five Benefits of Flutter';
String blog5_detailsdes1='1. One codebase. Flutter supports both Android and iOS mobile platforms, and because it renders everything by itself, it lets you run everything off one codebase. It\'s a big time-saver!\n\n2. Beautiful interfaces in no time. In Flutter, the user interface is built with widgets, small UI building blocks assembled using a technique called Composition.\n\n3. Pixel rendering. Flutter manages every pixel of the screen, so we can be sure that our widgets will look the same on every mobile device (even the older ones), essentially removing our potential device support woes. \n\n'
    '4. Faster development with Hot reload. This is where Flutter truly shines: hot reload feature provides the ability to introduce changes on-the-fly, allowing you to see them immediately during development. This feature makes the app development process significantly faster! \n\n5. Cross-platform app development. As already mentioned, the Flutter SDK is a cross-platform tool, that allows us to develop for desktop, mobile, and the Web using a single codebase. It also enables you to create beautiful, expressive UIs with \'s  widgets, layers and interactive assets.';

String blog5_detailsTitle2='Is Flutter Good for MVP development?';
String blog5_detailsdes2='In the development process, the MVP is an important step taken before the product becomes a full-fledged app. Such an approach offers a number of benefits:\n\n1. It saves time, money, and resources.\n2. It allows us to test business and product ideas and get rapid feedback from your user base.\n3. It helps you to prioritize tasks and separate the essential features from the nice-to-haves. ';

String blog5_detailsTitle3='Are there any cons of Flutter?';
String blog5_detailsdes3='1. It has limitations in terms of UI rendering on native platforms, e.g. video on Apple TV or Android TV.\n2. Features that are newly added on native iOS and Android systems will naturally be introduced in Flutter later than on their native versions. \n3. Although Flutter is easy to learn, you will probably need some experience with native app development to build a functional cross-platform app. ';

String blog5_detailsTitle4='Pros of React Native';
String blog5_detailsdes4='React Native is a fairly mature framework that also made a name for itself in the world of mobile development. What are its main benefits? \n\n1. It is a mature framework with stable API, backed by Facebook. \n2. It is easy to learn for React and JavaScript developers. You can take advantage of existing React libraries, tools, UI frameworks and tutorials. The framework also has a robust, helpful community.\n'
    '3. Just like Flutter, it allows fast development for iOS, Android and Web with one codebase. \n4. React Native allows you to add new code to a running app which decreases the risk of losing some functionalities during a whole reload or app rebuild. ';

String blog5_detailsTitle5='Cons of React Native';
String blog5_detailsdes5='1. It still lacks some custom, platform-specific modules and you may need expertise from a native developer to create them.\n2. The navigation is not as smooth and cross-platform development might cause performance and device-related app issues .\n3. It\'s not the best choice for apps that include games or heavy animations .';
